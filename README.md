## Problem Statement
Provided with the dataset of UIUC GPA containing various features such as academic term, year, student population, subject, course number, grade distribution, course title, and instructor name, the objective of this project is to analyze the dataset and provide insights on the following questions: 

___Is it possible to predict the grade distribution of UIUC courses in the future?___

With exploration of the dataset and its features, leveraging the deep learning techniques from the course, we hope to address the problem statement and provide insights to the class.
